  (0) Unknown: Failed to get convolution algorithm. This is probably because cuDNN failed to initialize, so try looking to see if a warning log message was printed above.

OPTIONS (is it a 19.04 problem?):
- Try in both venvs. Going in order of what I should try first to last:
	- py 3.6, tf 1.13, CUDA 10.0, CUDNN 7.4.1. --> check cudnn at /usr/include/cudnn.h  and cudnn at  /usr/local/cuda/version.txt
	- Could try to download toolkit from archive --> for cuda: /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc --version
	- Docker and bazel (0.19.2) install 
	- conda install on linux boot. If that doesnt work just uninstall and reinstall OS
	
*** Solved with:
        config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto()
        config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
