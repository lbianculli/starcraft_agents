Agents and utilities for pysc2 agents

10.13:

More of a collection of thoughts/code than anything else. If you want a reference to a well-coded repo that achieves pysc2 minigames w/ GPU compatability, see: https://github.com/inoryy/reaver/tree/master/reaver

For a cleaner representation of much of the pysc2-related work that can be found (somewhere) in this repo, see https://github.com/lbianculli/reaver_1, where I aim to extend functionality in the previously-referenced repo to extend to full games.

If you have any questions ask away!
